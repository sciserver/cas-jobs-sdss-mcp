The survey area contains four widely separated patches on the sky with a total sample of over 6000 redshifts, representing a sampling rate of about 45%.

COMBO17,Classifying Objects by Medium-Band Observations - a spectrophotometric 17-filter survey ,"This catalogue lists astrometry, photometry in 17 passbands from 350 to 930 nm, and ground-based morphological data for63,501 objects. The catalogue also contains multi-colour classification into the categories Star, Galaxy and Quasar as well asphotometric redshifts. We include restframe luminosities in Johnson, SDSS and Bessell passbands and estimated errors. The redshiftsare most reliable at R&lt;4, where the sample contains approximately 100 quasars, 1000 stars and 10000 galaxies. We use nearly 1000spectroscopically identified objects in conjunction with detailed simulations to characterize the performance of COMBO-17. We showthat the selection of quasars, more generally type-1 AGN, is nearly complete and minimally contaminated at z=[0.5,5] for luminositiesabove M_B=-21.7. Their photometric redshifts are accurate to roughly 5000 km/sec. Galaxy redshifts are accurate to 1% in dz/(1+z)at R&lt;21. They degrade in quality for progressively fainter galaxies, reaching accuracies of 2% for galaxies with R~22 and of 10% forgalaxies with R&gt;24. The selection of stars is complete to R~23, and deeper for M stars. We also present an updated discussion of ourclassification technique with maps of survey completeness, and discuss possible failures of the statistical classification in the faint regime at R&gt;24.",http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu/DataRelease/http://www.mpia.de/COMBO/combo_index.html
